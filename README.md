## 🐾 What MoMoChan Can Do! 🐾

- Watches over your tasks from the top of the screen (isn't she just the cutest??).
- You can add tasks with stickers (my favorite is the sparkle ✨).
- When you add a task, MoMoChan gets excited!
- When you finish a task and delete it, she does a happy dance! 🎉

## ✨ How to Use ✨

1. **Type your task** in the box where MoMoChan is waiting.
2. **Pick a sticker** (choose from stars, hearts, and more).
3. **Click the + button** or hit Enter to add your task.
4. Watch **MoMoChan’s adorable reaction**! She changes expressions!
5. When you’re done, **click the trash can** to delete the task — POOF! ✨
